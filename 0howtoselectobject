bpy.data.objects['Sphere.017']
refers to an object.

A python script can do something with that.

You can also use

bpy.data.objects['Cube'].select = True
# to select the object in the 3D viewport,
# this way you can also select multiple objects

# additionally you can use
bpy.context.scene.objects.active = bpy.data.objects['Sphere.017']
# to make it the active selected object
